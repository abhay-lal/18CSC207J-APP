## Advanced Programming Practice - SRM IST 

1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by  8 and multiple of 5, between 1000 and 2000 (both included) 

2. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. Note : User  is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt  appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get  a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit. 

3. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested  for loop.

5. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse  it. ( should not use any functions) 

6. Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n  (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element  value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. Note : i = 0,1.., m-1 
j = 0,1, n-1. 
Test Data : Rows = 3, Columns = 4 
Expected Result : [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4, 6]] 

6. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number  of digits and letters.  
Sample Data : SRMIST 2022 
Expected Output : 
Letters 6 
Digits 4

7. Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. Validation : 
At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]. At least 1 number between [0-9]. 
At least 1 character from [$#@]. 
Minimum length 6 characters. 
Maximum length 16 characters. 
Sample output 
Input your password srmist@2017 
Not a Valid Password 
Input your password Srmist@2022 
Valid Password 

8. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both  included) where each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers  obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence. 

9. Write a Python program to convert month name to a number of days. 

10. Write a Python program to sum of two given integers. However, if the  sum is between 105 to 200 it will return 200. 

11. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a  nested loop number. 

Expected Output: 
<br/>999999999 
<br/>88888888 
<br/>7777777 
<br/>666666 
<br/>55555 
<br/>4444 
<br/>333 
<br/>22 
<br/>1 

12. Write a Python program to create a histogram from a given list of  integers

13. Write a Python program that will return true if the two given integer  values are equal or their sum or difference is 5. 

14. Write a Python program to compute the distance between the points  (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). 

15. Function that takes a sequence of numbers and determines whether  all are different from each other 

16. Write a Python program to count the number of each character of a  given text 

17. Write a Python program that accepts a positive number and subtract  from this number the sum of its digits and so on. Continue this operation  until the number is positive. 

18. Write a Python program to find the digits which are absent in a given  mobile number. 

19. Write a Python program to reverse the digits of a given number and  add it to the original, If the sum is not a palindrome repeat this procedure

20. Write a Python program to print the length of the series and the series  from the given 3rd term, 3rd last term and the sum of a series.
